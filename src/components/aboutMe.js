                <p>
                  Currently finishing my Computer Science Engineering Degree focusing on Software Engineering
                  at the University of Granada, I am a 21 year old student based in Jerez de la Frontera,
                  CÃ¡diz, Spain. I'm passionate about sports, travelling, technology and basically everything that makes the Internet tick. <br/> <br/>
                  Eager to learn more about Software Engineering needs and make a positive impact
                  while developing acquired skills. Even though I do not have much professional work experience,
                  I always try to give my best, adapt and meet expectations. <br/> <br/>
                  Whether you're a business owner looking to get started on a app or web development project with a 
                  freelance web developer, a developer looking to collaborate on something cool, or just wanting to say hi, 
                  shoot me a message and let's work together.
